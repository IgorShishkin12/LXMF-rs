# RPC Contract (`reticulumd`) - CLI Stable Set

This document freezes the daemon RPC methods that `lxmf-sdk`, `lxmf-cli`, and
other operator-facing integrations rely on over the JSON-RPC/MessagePack daemon
surface.

Scope:
- Transport: HTTP `POST /rpc` with framed MessagePack payloads over Unix sockets, TCP, or TLS/mTLS.
- Experimental transport: feature-gated ZeroMQ pipeline RPC uses the same framed MessagePack RPC
  payload bytes inside an application envelope. HTTP remains the default and authoritative transport
  until the ZeroMQ release gates below pass.
- Event stream: HTTP `GET /events` with framed MessagePack events.
- Live event stream: HTTP `GET /events/stream` keeps the connection open and writes framed SDK
  event objects until the client disconnects. Frames use the same 4-byte big-endian length prefix
  as RPC request/response bodies, followed by a MessagePack-encoded SDK event object. `?cursor=...`
  performs catch-up before live fanout. Broadcast lag is reported as a typed `StreamGap` SDK event
  instead of silently resetting the cursor. The Rust SDK uses this native stream over Unix sockets,
  plain TCP, or TLS/mTLS, and falls back to cursor polling only for recovery/manual paths.
- Stability target: this method set and parameter shapes are considered stable for `0.1.x`.
- Message field-level payload IDs and structures are documented in `docs/contracts/payload-contract.md`.

Compatibility slice:
- `slice_id`: `rpc_v2`
- Matrix source: `docs/contracts/compatibility-matrix.md`
- Extension registry: `docs/contracts/extension-registry.md`
- Support windows: `N`, `N+1`, `N+2` with additive-only method evolution.

Reference tests:
- In-repo contract coverage: `cargo xtask release-check` and `cargo test -p rns-tools`.
- Golden corpus replay: `cargo run -p xtask -- interop-corpus-check`.
- Deterministic RPC replay trace: `cargo run -p rns-tools --bin rnx -- replay --trace docs/fixtures/sdk-v2/rpc/replay_known_send_cancel.v1.json`.
- External interoperability contract checks are executed from the dedicated interop repository.

## Wire framing

RPC request/response bodies are framed as:
- First 4 bytes: big-endian payload length (`u32`)
- Remaining bytes: MessagePack-encoded object

Frame payloads are capped at 16 MiB. Decoders must reject larger declared
lengths before waiting for the remaining body, and HTTP `POST /rpc` bodies must
reject content lengths larger than the 4-byte prefix plus the maximum payload.
HTTP request headers are capped at 64 KiB total, 8 KiB per line, and 128 header
fields. SDK RPC HTTP response reads are bounded to the response header cap plus
one maximum framed RPC body.

Request object:
- `id: u64`
- `method: string`
- `params: object | null` (method-specific)

Response object:
- `id: u64`
- `result: object | array | scalar | null`
- `error: { code: string, message: string } | null`

## Experimental ZeroMQ pipeline transport

Status: opt-in, feature-gated, not the default SDK transport.

Crate/API pin:

- Rust crate: `zeromq = 0.6.0`
- Enabled crate features: `tokio-runtime`, `tcp-transport`
- Initial socket pattern: paired `PUSH`/`PULL` sockets
- IPC transport is deferred for the first cross-platform pass.

Envelope:

- `protocol_version: u16`, currently `1`
- `session_id: string`
- `request_id: u64`
- `kind: request | response | event | control`
- `auth: { scheme, value } | null`
- `response_endpoint: string | null`
- `payload: bytes`, containing the existing framed MessagePack RPC request or response

Correlation is mandatory. SDK clients must accept a response only when both `session_id` and
`request_id` match the pending call. ZeroMQ socket identity, round-robin delivery, and peer ordering
are not sufficient for request/reply semantics.

Security:

- Loopback TCP endpoints may run in local-trusted mode.
- Non-local TCP endpoints fail closed unless explicit application-layer auth metadata is configured.
- The first auth mode is token/HMAC metadata equivalent to the HTTP bearer token semantics.
- mTLS is not provided by ZeroMQ and must not be inferred from the socket layer.
- IPC endpoints are deferred until the optional Unix-only transport feature is introduced.

Events:

- `sdk_poll_events_v2` cursor semantics remain authoritative.
- Pushed event envelopes are a wakeup/optimization path only until they prove identical gap, cursor,
  overflow, replay, and reset behavior.

## Stable method set

All methods below are required for full CLI feature coverage.

### Messaging
- `list_messages` (no params)
: Returns message list or `{ messages: [...] }`.
- `clear_messages` (no params)
- `announce_now` (no params)
- `send_message_v2`
: Params keys: `id`, `source`, `destination`, `title`, `content` (optional: `fields`, `method`, `stamp_cost`, `include_ticket`, `try_propagation_on_fail`, `source_private_key`).
- `send_message`
: Compatibility server method with params keys: `id`, `source`, `destination`, `title`, `content` (optional: `fields`, `source_private_key`).
- `record_receipt`
: Params keys: `message_id`, `status`.
- `message_delivery_trace`
: Params keys: `message_id`.
- `get_outbound_progress`
: Params keys: `message_id` or `lxm_hash`; returns current outbound progress or `null` when the message cannot be found.
- `get_outbound_lxm_stamp_cost`
: Params keys: `message_id` or `lxm_hash`; returns the normal stamp cost, or `null` when a ticket stamp is being used.
- `get_outbound_lxm_propagation_stamp_cost`
: Params keys: `message_id` or `lxm_hash`; returns the propagation stamp target cost when known.
- `sdk_cancel_message_v2`
: Params keys: `message_id`.

### Identity / status
- `daemon_status_ex` (no params)
: Must include `identity_hash` when available.
- `status` (no params)
: Fallback status method; must include `identity_hash` when available.

### Peers and interfaces
- `list_peers` (no params)
- `peer_sync`
: Params keys: `peer` (optional: `transfer_limit_kb`, `wanted_ids`). When
  `wanted_ids` is `true`, every offered message is transferred like Python's
  "wants all" offer response. When `wanted_ids` is `false` or an empty list,
  every offered ID is treated like a Python LXMF peer response indicating the
  peer already has those messages: they become handled but are not transferred.
  A non-empty list transfers only the supplied IDs and handles the rest. Each
  supplied wanted ID must be a 32-byte transient ID encoded as 64 hex
  characters; malformed wanted IDs are rejected before peer queue state is
  mutated. Numeric Python LXMPeer error response `0xf0` (`ERROR_NO_IDENTITY`)
  preserves the peer and queued offers for an immediate retry without generic
  backoff or unpeer cleanup. Numeric response `0xf1` (`ERROR_NO_ACCESS`)
  breaks local peering, clears peer propagation queue marks, and returns a
  `peer_unpeer`-shaped result with `reason: "access_denied"`. Numeric response
  `0xf6` (`ERROR_THROTTLED`) preserves the peer and queued offers, postpones
  `next_sync_attempt` by 180 seconds, and returns a postponed `peer_sync`
  result with `postpone_reason: "throttled"`. Other numeric responses,
  including `0xf3` (`ERROR_INVALID_KEY`), `0xf4` (`ERROR_INVALID_DATA`),
  `0xf5` (`ERROR_INVALID_STAMP`), `0xfd` (`ERROR_NOT_FOUND`), and `0xfe`
  (`ERROR_TIMEOUT`), preserve the peer and queued offers for retry, record the
  sync attempt, and avoid generic backoff or unpeer cleanup.
- `peer_unpeer`
: Params keys: `peer`. Result and `peer_unpeer` event include `removed`,
  `propagation_cleared`, `propagation_cleared_bytes`, top-level aggregate
  peer counters `offered`, `outgoing`, `incoming`, and `messages` with
  `offered`, `outgoing`, `incoming`, `unhandled`, byte counts, and handled /
  unhandled propagation IDs.
- `clear_peers` (no params)
- `list_interfaces` (no params)
- `set_interfaces`
: Params keys: `interfaces`
- `reload_config` (no params)
- `rnode_management`
: Params keys: `iface`, `command`; command-specific keys include `pattern`,
  display/NeoPixel fields, interference-avoidance flags, and, for
  `RNodeMultiInterface`, required child `vport`. Supported commands are
  `radio_state_query`/`query_radio_state`, `blink`,
  `config_read`/`read_config`, `rom_read`/`read_rom`, display
  intensity/blanking/rotation/recondition/address controls, NeoPixel
  intensity, interference-avoidance enable/disable controls, Bluetooth
  enable/disable/pair controls, config save/delete, ROM write/wipe, hard
  reset, firmware update/hash metadata, and Wi-Fi mode/channel/IP/netmask/
  SSID/PSK set or clear controls. Persistent/disruptive commands require
  `confirm_persistent=true`; destructive commands require
  `confirm_destructive=true` and `confirm_command` exactly matching the
  canonical command. Serial/TCP RNodeInterface handles, plus feature-gated BLE
  RNodeInterface handles when `reticulumd` is built with `rnode-ble`, are
  selected by runtime iface id or an unambiguous configured interface name.
  RNodeMulti handles are selected by parent runtime iface id or unambiguous
  configured parent name, then validate the requested child `vport`; missing
  or unconfigured vports are rejected. Successful responses report that the
  management frame was queued, not that the radio has completed the operation.

`list_interfaces` response notes:

- `interfaces[*].settings` may include a runtime metadata envelope at `_runtime` with fields:
  `startup_status`, optional `startup_error`, and optional `iface` (runtime interface id).
- Known `startup_status` values include: `disabled`, `inactive_transport_disabled`, `failed`,
  `spawned`, and `active`.
- This metadata is additive and intended for startup/degraded-mode observability.

Startup policy notes:

- `reticulumd --strict-interface-startup` makes startup/preflight interface failures fatal.
- Strict preflight currently includes `tcp_client` connect checks (2s timeout) and serial port open checks.
- TCP RPC binds on non-loopback addresses fail at startup unless a persisted SDK runtime config
  has `bind_mode=remote` with `auth_mode=token`/`mtls`, or mTLS client authentication is configured
  with `--rpc-tls-client-ca`.
- First-run remote token auth can be configured at daemon startup with `--rpc-token-issuer`,
  `--rpc-token-audience`, and `--rpc-token-secret-env`. The secret value is read from the named
  environment variable, not from argv.

### Interface mutation policy (`set_interfaces` and `reload_config`)

The following contract is mandatory in v1:

1. `set_interfaces` accepts only legacy hot-apply kinds (`tcp_client`, `tcp_server`).
2. If any startup-only kind is present (`local`, `serial`, `ble_gatt`, `lora`, or unknown future kinds),
   the request is rejected atomically with:
   - `error.code = "CONFIG_RESTART_REQUIRED"`
   - `error.machine_code = "UNSUPPORTED_MUTATION_KIND_REQUIRES_RESTART"`
   - details include operation and affected interface identifiers.
3. No partial apply is allowed when rejection occurs.
4. `reload_config` without params preserves legacy behavior and emits `config_reloaded`.
5. `reload_config` with `interfaces` params hot-applies only when interface list length/order/kinds
   remain legacy TCP-only; otherwise it returns the same restart-required error contract.

### Propagation
- `propagation_status` (no params)
- `propagation_enable`
: Params keys: `enabled`, `store_root`, `target_cost`
- `propagation_ingest`
: Params keys: `transient_id`, `payload_hex`
- `propagation_fetch`
: Params keys: `transient_id`
- `propagation_remote_sync`
: Params keys: `remote`, `peer` (optional: `identity_private_key_hex`, `timeout_secs`).
  `remote` is trimmed and must not be blank; invalid remotes are rejected
  before the bridge is called or local peer/sync state is updated.
  `propagation_status.propagation.sync_state` uses Python `LXMRouter.PR_*`
  values for remote sync lifecycle: request sent `0x04`, complete `0x07`,
  failed `0xfe`.
  Numeric peer error responses including `0xf0`, `0xf3`, `0xf4`, `0xf5`,
  `0xfd`, and `0xfe` are mapped to explicit bridge errors so retryable
  peer-response cleanup can preserve local peer and queue state without generic
  failure backoff. Other unexpected numeric control responses follow the same
  preserve-and-retry cleanup path; `0xf1` breaks local peering and `0xf6`
  applies throttle postponement.
- `propagation_acknowledge_sync_completion`
: Optional params keys: `reset_state`, `failure_state`. Mirrors Python
  `acknowledge_sync_completion`: clears progress, resets completed states to
  idle, and preserves failure states unless `reset_state` is true.
- `propagation_remote_unpeer`
: Mirrors local `peer_unpeer` cleanup accounting for the local peer state after
  the remote unpeer call succeeds, and includes the remote bridge `result`.
: Params keys: `remote`, `peer` (optional: `identity_private_key_hex`, `timeout_secs`).
  `remote` is trimmed and must not be blank; invalid remotes are rejected
  before the bridge is called or local peer state is removed.

### Stamp / tickets
- `stamp_policy_get` (no params)
- `stamp_policy_set`
: Params keys: `target_cost`, `flexibility`, `enforce`
- `ticket_generate`
: Params keys: `destination`, `ttl_secs`

## Compatibility policy

- New methods may be added without breaking this contract.
- Existing method names in this document must not be renamed or removed in `0.1.x`.
- Existing required parameter keys must remain accepted.
- Additive extension behavior must be tracked in `docs/contracts/extension-registry.md` with versioned IDs.
- CLI/runtime clients must call `send_message_v2` directly (no client fallback to `send_message`).
- Server must keep `send_message` for compatibility and apply the same strict canonical field validation path as `send_message_v2`.
- At least one of `daemon_status_ex` or `status` must provide `identity_hash` for source auto-resolution.
- Embedded link adapters (serial/BLE/LoRa) must preserve this RPC method/field contract when bridged through transport runtimes.

## Cryptographic Agility Policy

Algorithm negotiation roadmap is governed by `docs/adr/0007-crypto-agility-roadmap.md`.

Versioned algorithm-set ids:

| algorithm_set_id | Status | Baseline intent |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rns-a1` | active | current baseline interoperability profile |
| `rns-a2` | planned | strengthened signature/cipher suite profile |
| `rns-a3` | reserved | post-quantum transition profile placeholder |

Negotiation contract (additive roadmap for `sdk_negotiate_v2` extension fields):

1. Client advertises ordered `supported_algorithm_sets`.
2. Server returns one `selected_algorithm_set`.
3. Server selection must be within client-offered set.
4. If no overlap exists, negotiation fails with contract-incompatible semantics.
5. Selected algorithm set must be emitted in runtime/session metadata for auditability.

Downgrade and upgrade rules:

1. Downgrade from client-preferred set must be explicit in negotiation response.
2. Silent fallback to unknown/undeclared sets is forbidden.
3. New set ids must be additive and documented before runtime enablement.
