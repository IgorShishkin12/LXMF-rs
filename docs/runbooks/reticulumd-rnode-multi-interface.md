# `reticulumd` RNodeMulti Interface Runbook

## Purpose

This runbook documents the in-progress `RNodeMultiInterface` slice: one shared
serial or TCP RNode parent with nested virtual-port subinterfaces. It is not a
production-complete RNodeMulti parity claim.

## Scope

- Reticulum type alias: `RNodeMultiInterface`
- Default MTU: `508`, matching Python `RNodeMultiInterface.HW_MTU`
- Physical transport: one serial RNode device or `tcp://host:port` RNode
  endpoint opened at the parent level
- Child model: nested vport subinterfaces registered as virtual unicast
  children
- Multiplexing: KISS `CMD_SEL_INT` (`0x1f`) selects the active RNode virtual
  port before per-vport configuration or packet writes
- Startup probes: baseline validation now covers hardware detect, firmware
  version `>= 1.74`, platform, MCU, `CMD_INTERFACES` discovery, and configured
  vports reported by the device
- Display-aware teardown: ESP32 and NRF52 platforms detected during startup
  probe get Python-style external-framebuffer disable before per-vport
  shutdown frames
- Runtime status: selected-vport command responses update per-vport radio
  status bookkeeping in the transport runtime; the same status payload reports
  stream/probe state, accepted startup-probe firmware/platform/MCU/interface
  metadata, and the last open/probe/init/read error
- Management dispatch: daemon/RPC callers select the parent RNodeMulti
  interface by runtime iface id or unambiguous configured name, then pass the
  child `vport`; the transport queue writes KISS `CMD_SEL_INT` before each
  queued management command frame
- Exported status: daemon startup metadata includes an initial `radio_status`
  snapshot schema under `settings._runtime.rnode_multi`, and live daemon/RPC
  snapshots refresh from the transport-side runtime handle
- Strict startup: `--strict-interface-startup` preflights the configured serial
  port or TCP endpoint and fails startup before registering management targets
  when the parent endpoint cannot be opened
- Current posture: partial, with broader prepared-host hardware evidence and
  production parity still pending

## Configuration Model

The slice is organized as a parent interface with explicit child
subinterfaces. Each child owns a vport number, LoRa/RNode radio parameters, and
its own outgoing flag:

```toml
interfaces = [
  {
    type = "RNodeMultiInterface",
    enabled = true,
    name = "rnode-multi",
    port = "/dev/ttyACM0", # or "tcp://192.0.2.10:8001"
    speed = 115200,
    radio0 = {
      name = "rnode-multi-v0",
      vport = 0,
      region = "US915",
      frequency = 915000000,
      bandwidth = 125000,
      spreadingfactor = 9,
      codingrate = 5,
      txpower = 17,
      outgoing = true
    },
    radio1 = {
      name = "rnode-multi-v1",
      vport = 1,
      region = "US915",
      frequency = 917000000,
      bandwidth = 125000,
      spreadingfactor = 9,
      codingrate = 5,
      txpower = 17,
      outgoing = false
    }
  }
]
```

Keep `vport` assignments stable across restarts. The runtime maps each child
virtual interface address to its configured vport; changing child order or
vport values changes direct-routing behavior.
Child tables default to enabled. For Python-style Reticulum compatibility,
`enabled = false` disables a child when `interface_enabled` is absent; when
both fields are present, `interface_enabled` takes precedence.

## Startup Behavior

In normal best-effort startup mode, daemon startup registers the shared RNode
parent and child virtual interfaces immediately, then the transport task opens
the configured parent serial port/speed or TCP endpoint asynchronously. With
`--strict-interface-startup`, daemon startup first preflights the parent serial
open or TCP connect and records a startup failure instead of spawning the
interface when that endpoint is unavailable. The runtime registers one virtual
child interface per configured subinterface, applies the child's `outgoing`
policy to that virtual interface, and builds an address-to-vport map for direct
sends.

Before applying child configuration, the transport task validates that the
attached device responds to the RNode probe sequence. The baseline checks
require a detected RNode, firmware version `>= 1.74`, platform and MCU
metadata, `CMD_INTERFACES` support, and hardware-reported configured vports
that cover the requested child vports. Open/probe/init/read failures are
reflected in live `radio_status.stream_state` and `radio_status.last_error`
metadata even though the daemon startup record remains `spawned`.

For each child, startup writes:

1. KISS `CMD_SEL_INT` with the child vport.
2. The child LoRa/RNode configuration command frames.
3. Radio-state-on for that selected vport.

This gives each virtual port its own radio configuration while sharing the
same parent KISS stream.

## Packet Routing

Inbound packet handling is vport-aware:

- Plain KISS data frames are treated as vport `0`.
- Vport-specific KISS data command frames are mapped back to the child vport
  they represent.
- Packets from known vports are delivered to the matching virtual child
  interface.
- Packets from unmapped vports are ignored.

Outbound packet handling follows the Reticulum interface role:

- Direct sends to a virtual child select that child's vport with
  `CMD_SEL_INT`, then write the packet as KISS data.
- Broadcast sends fan out to every configured child whose `outgoing` flag is
  `true`.
- Broadcast sends do not fan out to receive-only children.

## Management Dispatch

The daemon binds each RNodeMulti parent into the safe `rnode_management` RPC
bridge. Callers select the parent by runtime iface id or by an unambiguous
configured parent name, then provide the intended child `vport` in params:

```json
{
  "iface": "rnode-multi",
  "command": "blink",
  "vport": 2,
  "pattern": 3
}
```

The bridge rejects missing `vport` values and vports that were not configured
on the selected parent. A successful RPC response means the management frame
was queued for the transport task, not that the radio has completed the
operation.

The transport exposes a cloneable `RNodeMultiManagementHandle` for already
encoded RNode management command frames. Each queued item carries the validated
child vport. The stream selects that vport with `CMD_SEL_INT`, writes the
management command frame, and flushes the shared serial/TCP stream. Local
duplex coverage proves this ordering with a blink management frame.

## Status Routing

RNodeMulti status handling tracks the currently selected virtual port from
`CMD_SEL_INT` responses. Subsequent radio command/status responses are applied
to that selected child status record, matching Python's selected-index model.
Packet data command frames continue to route by their explicit vport command
byte and do not change the selected status vport.

The daemon startup record exposes the configured RNodeMulti status schema under
`settings._runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status`. This gives RPC consumers stable
keys for `selected_vport`, known `vports`, and per-vport radio fields before
hardware has reported live values. While the daemon is running,
`daemon_status_ex` and interface listing snapshots refresh that
`radio_status` object from the transport-side runtime handle. The refreshed
object includes `stream_state`, `last_error`, and `startup_probe`, so absent
hardware or a failed probe is visible to RPC consumers instead of appearing as
successful telemetry. After a non-cancelled startup-probe attempt,
`startup_probe` records the accepted or partial `detected`, firmware version,
platform, MCU, hardware-reported vport interface types, and an
`interface_summary` string for prepared-host evidence capture.
Each subinterface uses the ordinary RNode radio-status JSON schema, including
battery labels, framebuffer/display byte counts, random byte, and derived
reported bitrate when the selected vport has reported enough radio parameters.
`rnstatus-rs` human output summarizes the same runtime state with the stream
state, selected vport, vport count, startup-probe firmware/platform/MCU/interface
details, and last error so operators can see failed open/probe/read states
without switching to JSON output.

## Software Fake-TCP Smoke

The software fake-TCP smoke validates the daemon path without attached RNode
hardware:

```bash
./tools/scripts/rnode-multi-fake-tcp-smoke.sh
```

The script starts a local fake TCP RNodeMulti peer on `127.0.0.1:0`, accepts
the strict-startup preflight connection, answers the real runtime startup probe
for detect, firmware `1.74`, ESP32 platform, MCU, and `CMD_INTERFACES`
metadata for vports `2` and `3`, then starts `reticulumd` with
`--strict-interface-startup`. A passing run requires:

- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.stream_state = "running"`
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.vports` containing `2` and `3`
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.startup_probe.firmware_version.label =
  "1.74"`
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.startup_probe.platform = 128`
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.startup_probe.mcu = 1`
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.startup_probe.interface_summary =
  "2:SX126X,3:SX128X"`
- human `rnstatus-rs` output summarizing the same startup-probe metadata
- `rnodeconf-rs blink --interface rnode-multi-fake-tcp --vport 2 --pattern 3`
  returning a queued management result
- the fake peer recording `CMD_SEL_INT` before a blink management command
  (`CMD_BLINK`) for vport `2`

The smoke writes structured evidence under
`target/rnode-multi-fake-tcp-smoke/`, including `report.json`, the fake-peer
state with `management_blink_seen`, daemon logs, `rnstatus-rs` JSON/human
output, and the `rnodeconf-rs` management response. This proves Python-style
TCP parent config, strict daemon startup, startup-probe status refresh,
`rnstatus-rs`, and vport management dispatch through the real daemon path. It
is still not a substitute for prepared-host execution against real RNodeMulti
hardware.

## Software Fake-PTY Smoke

The software fake-PTY smoke validates the serial parent path without attached
RNode hardware:

```bash
./tools/scripts/rnode-multi-fake-pty-smoke.sh
```

The script starts a raw pseudo-terminal fake peer, keeps the PTY slave device
available across strict-startup preflight and the runtime serial open, and
starts `reticulumd` with a Python-style serial `RNodeMultiInterface` config
using `speed = 115200`. The fake peer answers the real runtime startup probe
for detect, firmware `1.74`, ESP32 platform, MCU, and `CMD_INTERFACES`
metadata for vports `2` and `3`. A passing run requires:

- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.stream_state = "running"`
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.vports` containing `2` and `3`
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.startup_probe.firmware_version.label =
  "1.74"`
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.startup_probe.platform = 128`
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.startup_probe.mcu = 1`
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.startup_probe.interface_summary =
  "2:SX126X,3:SX128X"`
- human `rnstatus-rs` output summarizing the same startup-probe metadata
- `rnodeconf-rs blink --interface rnode-multi-fake-pty --vport 2 --pattern 3`
  returning a queued management result
- the fake peer recording `CMD_SEL_INT` before a blink management command
  (`CMD_BLINK`) for vport `2`

The smoke writes structured evidence under
`target/rnode-multi-fake-pty-smoke/`, including `report.json`, the fake-peer
state with `management_blink_seen`, daemon logs, `rnstatus-rs` JSON/human
output, and the `rnodeconf-rs` management response. This proves the RNodeMulti
serial software path, strict daemon startup, startup-probe status refresh,
`rnstatus-rs`, and vport management dispatch through the real daemon path. It
is still not a substitute for prepared-host execution against real RNodeMulti
hardware.

## Prepared-Host Smoke

The opt-in prepared-host smoke validates the daemon against a host that has a
real RNodeMulti-capable device exposed as either a serial port or a
`tcp://host:port` bridge:

```bash
RNODE_MULTI_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0 \
RNODE_MULTI_BAUD_RATE=115200 \
RNODE_MULTI_VPORTS=0,1 \
./tools/scripts/rnode-multi-prepared-host-smoke.sh
```

For TCP bridges, set `RNODE_MULTI_PORT=tcp://192.0.2.10:8001`; the generated
config omits serial baud rate in that mode. `RNODE_MULTI_VPORTS` is a
comma-separated list of child vports; radio parameter variables accept either
one value reused for every vport or one comma-separated value per vport:
`RNODE_MULTI_FREQUENCIES`, `RNODE_MULTI_BANDWIDTHS`,
`RNODE_MULTI_SPREADING_FACTORS`, `RNODE_MULTI_CODING_RATES`,
`RNODE_MULTI_TX_POWERS`, and `RNODE_MULTI_OUTGOING`. `RNODE_MULTI_REGION`
defaults to `US915`.

The script starts `reticulumd` with `--strict-interface-startup`, waits for
`rnstatus-rs --json`, and records pass/fail evidence under
`target/rnode-multi-hil/`. The readiness gate requires:

- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.stream_state = "running"`
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.vports` exactly matches
  `RNODE_MULTI_VPORTS`
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.startup_probe.firmware_version.label`
  is present
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.startup_probe.platform` and
  `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.startup_probe.mcu` are present
- `_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.startup_probe.interfaces` includes each
  configured vport
- one exported `radio_status.subinterfaces` record per configured vport
- `last_error = null`

The `running` state is reached only after the transport-side startup probe has
accepted detect, firmware `>= 1.74`, platform, MCU, `CMD_INTERFACES`, and
configured-vport validation. The smoke records those raw probe details in JSON
so firmware/platform/MCU/interface assertions can be made directly from
`rnstatus-rs --json`, including failed probe attempts where the hardware
reported enough metadata before validation failed.

Nightly HIL exposes the same smoke behind repository variables:

- `HIL_RNODE_MULTI_ENABLED=true`
- `HIL_RNODE_MULTI_PORT`
- `HIL_RNODE_MULTI_BAUD_RATE`
- `HIL_RNODE_MULTI_VPORTS`
- `HIL_RNODE_MULTI_FREQUENCIES`
- `HIL_RNODE_MULTI_BANDWIDTHS`
- `HIL_RNODE_MULTI_SPREADING_FACTORS`
- `HIL_RNODE_MULTI_CODING_RATES`
- `HIL_RNODE_MULTI_TX_POWERS`
- `HIL_RNODE_MULTI_OUTGOING`
- `HIL_RNODE_MULTI_TIMEOUT_SECS`

Artifacts are uploaded as `rnode-multi-prepared-host-artifacts`, including
`target/rnode-multi-hil/report.json` and the latest `target/rnode-multi-hil/run.*`
directory.
The report records `evidence_scope =
"prepared_host_single_device_vport_probe"` and a `product_boundary` note: a
passing run proves the configured serial/TCP endpoint, startup probe, and vport
status for that prepared host, not broad production parity across device,
firmware, and radio combinations.

## Shutdown Behavior

Shutdown iterates each child vport and writes:

1. For display-capable ESP32/NRF52 devices detected during startup probe,
   external-framebuffer disable.
2. KISS `CMD_SEL_INT` with the child vport.
3. Radio-state-off for that selected vport.
4. RNode leave-host payload `0xff` for that selected vport.

The shutdown sequence is best-effort; the stream is flushed before the shared
serial session closes. When the parent RNodeMulti interface stops, configured
virtual vport children are also stopped and removed from the interface manager
so stale child routes do not remain after parent shutdown.
Clean stream EOF and software cancellation/stop mark
`_runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status.stream_state = "closed"` without a terminal
error, while read/write/probe failures keep their failure state and
`last_error` for operators and `rnstatus-rs`.

## Known Gaps

- `I2PInterface` has a separate in-progress SAM peer/connectable slice;
  prepared-host production evidence is not complete.
- `WeaveInterface` has a separate in-progress WDCL/HDLC endpoint slice; full
  display/stat and hardware parity is not complete.
- Selected-vport radio command/status bookkeeping, an initial exported
  `radio_status` schema, stream/probe failure state, live daemon snapshot
  refresh, and an opt-in prepared-host smoke harness exist, but broad
  prepared-host telemetry evidence across devices and firmware combinations is
  not yet at Python parity.
- The startup probe baseline has validation for detect, firmware `>= 1.74`,
  platform, MCU, `CMD_INTERFACES`, and configured hardware vports, but full
  prepared-host hardware evidence across devices and firmware combinations is
  still required.
- Broader RNodeMulti production parity remains incomplete; release notes should
  not describe this family as production-complete yet.

## Verification Focus

Useful coverage for this slice should prove:

- Startup writes `CMD_SEL_INT` before each child configuration.
- Startup rejects devices that fail detect, firmware `>= 1.74`, platform, MCU,
  `CMD_INTERFACES`, or configured-vport validation.
- Direct outbound packets select exactly the target child's vport.
- Inbound vport data is delivered to the matching virtual child interface.
- Broadcast packets are written once per outgoing child and skipped for
  receive-only children.
- `CMD_SEL_INT` status responses select the child status record that subsequent
  radio command/status responses update.
- Startup metadata and live daemon/RPC snapshots expose
  `settings._runtime.rnode_multi.radio_status` with stable per-vport status
  keys.
- Shutdown sends radio-off and leave-host frames for each child vport.
- Daemon/RPC management dispatch rejects missing or unconfigured child `vport`
  values after resolving the selected parent interface.
- Vport-aware management dispatch writes `CMD_SEL_INT` immediately before the
  queued management command frame.
