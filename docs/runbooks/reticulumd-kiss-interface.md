# `reticulumd` KISS Interface Runbook

## Purpose

This runbook documents active KISS interface startup and the modem
configuration fields exposed by `reticulumd`. KISS is the framing layer; the
connection underneath can be serial, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi/TCP, or another byte
stream transport.

## Scope

- Interface kinds: `kiss`, `ax25_kiss`, `kiss_tcp_client`
- Reticulum type aliases: `KISSInterface`, `AX25KISSInterface`
- Active transports: serial KISS modem, serial AX.25 KISS TNC,
  TCP-connected KISS modem or bridge
- Runtime mutation policy: `set_interfaces`/`reload_config` with `kiss`,
  `ax25_kiss`, or `kiss_tcp_client` changes require restart

## Required Config Fields

Serial KISS:

```toml
interfaces = [
  {
    type = "kiss",
    enabled = true,
    name = "kiss-main",
    device = "/dev/ttyACM0",
    baud_rate = 9600,
    preamble_ms = 350,
    tx_tail_ms = 20,
    persistence = 64,
    slot_time_ms = 20,
    kiss_flow_control = true
  }
]
```

Reticulum-style serial KISS configuration keys are also accepted for migration
from Python configs. `type = "KISSInterface"` normalizes to `kiss`, `port`
maps to `device`, `speed` maps to `baud_rate`, and `databits`, `stopbits`,
`preamble`, `txtail`, `slottime`, and boolean `flow_control` map to the
corresponding Rust fields. When `speed` is omitted on the Python
`KISSInterface` alias, `baud_rate` defaults to Python's `9600` baud:

```toml
interfaces = [
  {
    type = "KISSInterface",
    enabled = true,
    name = "kiss-main",
    port = "/dev/ttyACM0",
    speed = 9600,
    databits = 8,
    parity = "N",
    stopbits = 1,
    preamble = 350,
    txtail = 20,
    persistence = 64,
    slottime = 20,
    flow_control = true,
    outgoing = false,
    bitrate = 1200,
    announce_cap = 5,
    id_callsign = "MYCALL-0",
    id_interval = 600
  }
]
```

TCP KISS, for example a KISS modem or bridge reachable over Wi-Fi:

```toml
interfaces = [
  {
    type = "kiss_tcp_client",
    enabled = true,
    name = "kiss-wifi",
    host = "192.0.2.10",
    port = 8001,
    preamble_ms = 350,
    tx_tail_ms = 20,
    persistence = 64,
    slot_time_ms = 20,
    kiss_flow_control = true
  }
]
```

AX.25 KISS, for example a serial KISS TNC carrying Reticulum packets inside a
Python-compatible AX.25 UI header:

```toml
interfaces = [
  {
    type = "AX25KISSInterface",
    enabled = true,
    name = "ax25-main",
    port = "/dev/ttyUSB0",
    speed = 1200,
    callsign = "N0CALL",
    ssid = 1,
    preamble = 350,
    txtail = 20,
    persistence = 64,
    slottime = 20,
    flow_control = true,
    id_callsign = "N0CALL-1",
    id_interval = 600
  }
]
```

Python `TCPClientInterface` entries with `kiss_framing = true` are normalized
to `kiss_tcp_client`; `target_host` and `target_port` map to `host` and `port`,
and `fixed_mtu` maps to `mtu`. Like Python Reticulum, `fixed_mtu = 0` keeps
the default TCP MTU and non-zero values must be at least the Reticulum MTU of
500 bytes:

```toml
interfaces = [
  {
    type = "TCPClientInterface",
    enabled = true,
    name = "python-kiss-tcp",
    target_host = "192.0.2.10",
    target_port = 8001,
    kiss_framing = true,
    fixed_mtu = 512
  }
]
```

## Validation Rules

- For `kiss`, `device` is required when enabled.
- For `kiss`, `baud_rate` is required and must be greater than zero when
  enabled.
- For `KISSInterface` compatibility, `port` is accepted as `device`, `speed`
  as `baud_rate`, `databits` as `data_bits`, `stopbits` as `stop_bits`,
  `preamble` as `preamble_ms`, `txtail` as `tx_tail_ms`, `slottime` as
  `slot_time_ms`, and boolean `flow_control` as `kiss_flow_control`. If
  `speed` is omitted, the Python alias uses the Python default `9600`.
  Android-style `beacon_interval` and `beacon_data` are accepted as aliases
  for the existing Python ID beacon fields `id_interval` and `id_callsign`;
  canonical `id_*` fields take precedence when both forms are supplied.
- For `AX25KISSInterface` compatibility, `port` is accepted as `device`,
  `speed` as `baud_rate`, `databits` as `data_bits`, `stopbits` as
  `stop_bits`, `preamble` as `preamble_ms`, `txtail` as `tx_tail_ms`,
  `slottime` as `slot_time_ms`, and boolean `flow_control` as
  `kiss_flow_control`. If `speed` is omitted, the Python alias uses the Python
  default `9600`.
- For `ax25_kiss`, `callsign` and `ssid` are required when enabled.
  `callsign` must be 3 to 6 ASCII alphanumeric characters and `ssid` must be
  between 0 and 15.
- When `kiss_flow_control` or compatibility `flow_control` is enabled, the
  stream starts ready after the KISS startup frames are flushed, matching
  Python `KISSInterface` configuration. The first outbound packet is sent
  immediately, then subsequent packets wait for device `CMD_READY` frames.
  If a modem misses `CMD_READY`, the stream unlocks flow control after the
  Python-compatible five-second timeout and sends the next queued packet.
- Startup always writes the Python KISS `CMD_READY 0x01` setup command,
  independent of whether runtime READY flow-control gating is enabled.
- Inbound KISS escape decoding mirrors Python's lenient read loop: `FESC TFEND`
  and `FESC TFESC` are translated, an unknown byte after `FESC` is retained
  literally, and a trailing `FESC` before frame end is dropped.
- Oversized inbound KISS payloads are capped to the configured MTU and still
  delivered, matching Python's `HW_MTU` buffer-retention behavior.
- Stale partial inbound frames are discarded after Python's KISS serial read
  timeout before later bytes are decoded.
- Serial KISS parity accepts Reticulum shorthand (`N`, `E`, `O`) and long-form
  names (`none`, `even`, `odd`).
- For `kiss_tcp_client`, `host` and `port` are required when enabled.
- For `kiss_tcp_client`, `port` must be greater than zero.
- Python `TCPClientInterface` with `kiss_framing = true` selects
  `kiss_tcp_client`; without KISS framing it remains a normal `tcp_client`.
- `mtu` defaults to 564 and must be between 64 and 65535 if provided.
- `reconnect_backoff_ms` defaults to 500 and must be at least 50 if provided.
- `max_reconnect_backoff_ms` defaults to at least 5000 and must be greater
  than or equal to `reconnect_backoff_ms`.
- `id_callsign` and `id_interval` are accepted for Reticulum-style station
  identification. If `id_interval` is configured without `id_callsign`, Python
  `KISSInterface` parity emits an empty station-ID payload padded to 15 bytes.
  If `id_callsign` is provided, it must be non-empty and at most 32 bytes.
  `id_interval` is seconds and must be greater than zero.
- `outgoing` defaults to `true`. Set `outgoing = false` to keep the interface
  available for inbound traffic while suppressing daemon-initiated outbound
  broadcast and direct transmissions on that interface.
- `bitrate` and `announce_cap` are accepted as Reticulum-style per-interface
  announce pacing controls. `bitrate` is bits per second; `announce_cap` is a
  percentage in the range `1..=100`. Unspecified fields keep the runtime
  defaults.

## Active Device Behavior

Startup writes KISS modem commands for preamble, TX tail, persistence, slot
time, and Python's READY setup command. Packet I/O uses KISS data frames;
inbound READY commands release one queued outbound frame when flow control is enabled.
The same KISS codec and startup commands are used by the serial, AX.25, and
TCP bearers. AX.25 KISS wraps outbound Reticulum packets in an AX.25 UI header
with destination callsign `APZRNS` and strips the first 16 bytes from inbound
AX.25 frames before Reticulum packet decoding, matching Python
`AX25KISSInterface` behavior. For Python `KISSInterface` parity, serial and
TCP KISS strip the high port nibble from inbound KISS command bytes and treat
the low nibble as the single supported port command. RNode/LoRa keeps full
command bytes because
Python `RNodeInterface` uses full values such as firmware command `0x50`.
If a peer starts a frame and then goes quiet beyond the Python KISS read
timeout, the partial frame is dropped before later bytes are decoded.

When `id_interval` is configured, the KISS stream emits the callsign as a KISS
data frame after a real outbound packet and the configured interval have
elapsed. For Python `KISSInterface` parity, a missing callsign is treated as an
empty payload and callsigns shorter than 15 bytes are zero-padded before
transmission. RNode station identification uses the same scheduling path but
requires a callsign and does not apply this serial KISS padding.

## Health Signals

Expected startup log:

- `kiss enabled iface=<iface> name=<name> device=<device> baud_rate=<baud>`
- `ax25_kiss enabled iface=<iface> name=<name> device=<device> baud_rate=<baud>`
- `kiss_tcp_client enabled iface=<iface> name=<name> endpoint=<host>:<port>`

Runtime status visibility:

- `list_interfaces` includes `_runtime.startup_status = "spawned"`.
- `list_interfaces` includes `_runtime.iface` with the active interface hash.

## Software Fake-PTY Smoke

The software fake-PTY smoke validates the serial KISS daemon path without
attached TNC or modem hardware:

```bash
./tools/scripts/kiss-fake-pty-smoke.sh
```

The script starts two raw pseudo-terminal fake peers, keeps their PTY slave
devices available across strict-startup preflight and runtime serial opens, and
starts `reticulumd` with Python-style `KISSInterface` and `AX25KISSInterface`
configs. The fake peers decode KISS frames, record the startup command
sequence, and send a `CMD_READY` frame back to the daemon. A passing run
requires:

- `_runtime.startup_status = "spawned"`
- `_runtime.kiss.status.link_state = "running"`
- `_runtime.kiss.status.bearer = "serial"`
- `_runtime.kiss.status.interface_ready = true`
- `_runtime.kiss.status.init_frames_tx >= 5`
- `_runtime.kiss.status.command_frames_rx >= 1`
- `_runtime.kiss.status.ready_frames_rx >= 1`
- `_runtime.kiss.status.bytes_tx` to cover the startup command frames
- `_runtime.kiss.status.bytes_rx` to cover the fake READY response
- the AX.25 row to report `_runtime.kiss.status.ax25 = true`
- human `rnstatus-rs` output to summarize the running serial KISS rows
- the fake peer recording all KISS startup command frames:
  `CMD_TXDELAY`, `CMD_TXTAIL`, `CMD_P`, `CMD_SLOTTIME`, and `CMD_READY`

The smoke writes structured evidence under `target/kiss-fake-pty-smoke/`,
including `report.json`, fake-peer frame state, daemon logs, and `rnstatus-rs`
JSON/human output. This proves Python-style serial KISS and AX.25 KISS config,
strict daemon startup, KISS startup frame emission, READY command handling, and
refreshed operator status through the real daemon path. It is local-only
evidence, not a substitute for real TNC or modem hardware evidence.

## Software Fake-TCP Smoke

The software fake-TCP smoke validates the Python `TCPClientInterface`
`kiss_framing = true` daemon path, normalized to `kiss_tcp_client`, without a
real Wi-Fi KISS bridge or TCP-attached modem:

```bash
./tools/scripts/kiss-fake-tcp-smoke.sh
```

The script starts a local fake TCP KISS server, waits for its listener port, and
starts `reticulumd` with a Python-style `TCPClientInterface` config using
`kiss_framing = true`. Strict startup first proves the configured endpoint is
reachable, then the runtime KISS TCP client connects, emits startup commands,
and receives a fake `CMD_READY` response. A passing run requires:

- `_runtime.startup_status = "spawned"`
- `_runtime.kiss_tcp.status.link_state = "running"`
- `_runtime.kiss_tcp.status.bearer = "tcp"`
- `_runtime.kiss_tcp.status.endpoint` to match the fake TCP server
- `_runtime.kiss_tcp.status.interface_ready = true`
- `_runtime.kiss_tcp.status.init_frames_tx >= 5`
- `_runtime.kiss_tcp.status.command_frames_rx >= 1`
- `_runtime.kiss_tcp.status.ready_frames_rx >= 1`
- `_runtime.kiss_tcp.status.bytes_tx` to cover the startup command frames
- `_runtime.kiss_tcp.status.bytes_rx` to cover the fake READY response
- human `rnstatus-rs` output to summarize the running TCP KISS row
- the fake server recording all KISS startup command frames:
  `CMD_TXDELAY`, `CMD_TXTAIL`, `CMD_P`, `CMD_SLOTTIME`, and `CMD_READY`

The smoke writes structured evidence under `target/kiss-fake-tcp-smoke/`,
including `report.json`, fake-server frame state, daemon logs, and
`rnstatus-rs` JSON/human output. This proves Python-style TCP KISS alias
normalization, strict daemon startup, KISS startup frame emission, READY command
handling, and refreshed operator status through the real daemon path. It is
local-only evidence, not a substitute for real Wi-Fi KISS bridge or modem
hardware evidence.
